What happens when you initialize a repository? Why
do you need to do it?

It begins communication with the directory and git
so that the status of the directory will start being
tracked.

How is the staging area different from the working
directory and the repository? What value do you think
it offers?

The staging area lets you see what you will commit, and
what files are and aren't being tracked.  It's useful as
a kind of last double-check to make sure you know what
you'll be saving.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have
one commit per logical change?

You can manually decide which files will be updated, so
that the commits make logical sense.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful
in keeping your history organized? How would branches
help?

If you'd like to try adding a feature but still want a
version you know will work that you can easily demo, you
could create a branch for the feature so that the working
version will be preserved.
