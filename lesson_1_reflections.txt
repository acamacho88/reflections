How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see
the bug that was introduced?

Seeing the two file lines together made it easy to find differences.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make
you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

You would be able to always see where something went wrong and more
easily learn from your mistakes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to
create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically
saved, like Google docs does?

Pros: you control it, not too many changes, not too few
Cons: up to you, you might forget to save

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving
multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat
each file separately?

Google Docs isn't explicitly for programming, it's not very likely
multiple files will be related to each other in that way.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history
of files?

git log to see a list of the commits, and then git diff to directly
compare two different commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes
that could break something?

You know you'd always be able to revert to a version that did work

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using
Git for?

Keeping versions of my projects on record, collaborating with others
