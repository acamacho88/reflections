When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you might be working on the project from multiple computers or sharing your work among groups of people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

In case there are any changes on your local repository that you don't want overwritten.
