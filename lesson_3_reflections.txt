When would you want to use a remote repository rather
than keeping all your work local?

If you might be working on the project from multiple
computers or sharing your work among groups of people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually
rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date
with your remote repository?

In case there are any changes on your local repository
that you don't want overwritten.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and
branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is a copy on Github of another Github repository.
Cloning can be done from Github -> local or local ->
local.
Branching is just creating a different path in your
code progression.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known
state of the remote stored locally?

You can pick up working where others may have left off
when they last pushed to Github.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?
What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Using Google Docs or trading files through email.
Being able to see changes as they're happening would be
easier with Google Docs, but having a record and being
able to experiment with different branches would not be
easy.
